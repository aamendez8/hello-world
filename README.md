Learning Git tutorial
Hello my name is Abraham I have been searching for something new to learn and found an interest in Full-stack development. 
I enjoy coding at the beach with some margaritas, I netfilx & code for fun when I get a chance and I currently dislike my job as a Letter Carrier. So I will continue to learn to find a job or participate in projects that are interesting to me.

Interested in learning Node.js and Angular.
